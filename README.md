## FAQ

### Why use Vite?

Because it’s convenient for setting breakpoints. As a front-end developer, I am more familiar with browser breakpoints than VSCode's debugging tools. Additionally, it saves the trouble of configuring files like `tsconfig.json` and `task.json`.

### How do I write problems?

When writing a problem, simply `import` the corresponding problem in the `main` file. This allows the problem code to be executed.  
Of course, before running it, you should use `npm run dev`, and if dependencies are missing, then run `npm i`. No further explanation needed.
